													Right now the publisher is projecting mid-July, 
													but at this time they are not able to commit to a specific printing or delivery date. <br />
													If you pay for the home delivery option, obviously you will get your book 
													as soon as it is printed and shipped.
													If your book comes to us and it arrives before school is back in session,
													we will contact you by email and arrange for a time for you to pick it up somewhere local.

												<td>What are you even going to put in the yearbook?</td>
												<td>We've had to be a little creative on this one!<br />
													1. The book will be a bit shorter than what we usually publish.<br />
													2. We still have lots of content -- student and staff portraits, fall and mid-year events.<br />
													3. We're including pages of pictures of what "school" looks like now!
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Ooh, I have pictures, can you use those?</td>
												<td>Yes!<br />
													Well, probably.  If they are pictures of your kid at school or a school event, definitely.
													If there are other students in the pictures, we'll need those students' names to verify
													that we have permission from their parents.<br />
													Ordinarily we request only pictures of students at school or school events, but this year, since school IS home,
													we want your pictures of what school looks like while we are learning remotely.  That means if
													you're growing a garden or learning the nose flute or reading to pets, we want pictures of it all!<br />
													Of course we can't use every picture we get, but many of our images come from parents and without 
													those submissions, we wouldn't have enough material to put a book together.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>How can I get you my pictures?</td>
												<td>Email is the easiest way.<br />
													Email your images to us at <a href="mailto:yearbook@mtpilchuckpta.org">yearbook@MtPilchuckPTA.org</a>.
													Please don't forget to include the names of the students in the pictures, their grades, and which class they are in.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>When do you need the pictures?</td>
												<td>The sooner the better.<br />
													The sooner we know how many and what images we have, the sooner we can plan the pages and start building them.
													It takes quite a bit of time to put a yearbook together, and the earlier we can start, the better off we are.
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Whose art is going to be on the cover?</td>
												<td>Results of our Cover Art Contest in January showed an overwhelming winner.<br />
													Ordinarily, we save the cover as a surprise for when the books come, 
													but since students won't be together when that happens, we want to publicly acknowledge our winner.<br />
													We'll be announcing the winner on 
													<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MtPilchuckPTA" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>
													at the start of the sale, so be sure to stop by and congratulation the talented winner!</a>
