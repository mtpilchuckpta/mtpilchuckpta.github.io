										<td>How do I order a yearbook?</td>
										<td>The pre-order period for the 2019-20 yearbook was the first two weeks of
											June.

										<td>When will I get my yearbook?</td>
										<td>Yearbooks were shipped on August 24th.
											If you ordered online for home delivery and your yearbook has not arrived,
											please refer to your receipt from the publisher.<br><br>
											If you ordered for pickup, the books have arrived. You may pick them up from
											the school office.

										<td>Is it too late to get a 2019-20 yearbook? My kid really wants one.</td>
										<td>We had a limited number of extra copies printed, and will be making these
											copies available to purchase at a cost of $15 each.<br>
											To pre-pay for one or more copies, please visit <a

										<td>What's in the yearbook?</td>
										<td>We had to get a little creative because of lack of at-school events, but
											we're very proud of the result!<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; * At 52 pages, this year's book is somewhat shorter than the
											68 pages that we typically publish.<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; * We had student and staff portraits, and pictures from our
											fall and mid-year events.<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; * 3. We included some really fun pages of pictures of what
											"school" looked like after the shutdown!<br>
											&nbsp; &nbsp; * 4. We got some great shots the the last day caravan.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<!--										<tr>
 											<td>Ooh, I have pictures, can you use those?</td>
											<td>Yes!<br>
												Well, probably.  If they are pictures of your kid at school or a school event, definitely.
												If there are other students in the pictures, we'll need those students' names to verify
												that we have permission from their parents.<br>
												Ordinarily we request only pictures of students at school or school events, but this year, since school IS home,
												we want your pictures of what school looks like while we are learning remotely.  That means if
												you're growing a garden or learning the nose flute or reading to pets, we want pictures of it all!<br>
												Of course we can't use every picture we get, but many of our images come from parents and without 
												those submissions, we wouldn't have enough material to put a book together.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>How can I get you my pictures?</td>
											<td>Email is the easiest way.<br>
												Email your images to us at <a href="mailto:yearbook@mtpilchuckpta.org">yearbook@MtPilchuckPTA.org</a>.
												Please don't forget to include the names of the students in the pictures, their grades, and which class they are in.
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>When do you need the pictures?</td>
											<td>The sooner the better.<br>
												The sooner we know how many and what images we have, the sooner we can plan the pages and start building them.
												It takes quite a bit of time to put a yearbook together, and the earlier we can start, the better off we are.
											</td>
										</tr>  -->
									<!--										<tr>
											<td>What about the cover art?</td>
											<td>Results of our Cover Art Contest in January showed an overwhelming winner.<br>
												Ordinarily, we save the cover as a surprise for when the books come, 
												but since students won't be together when that happens, we want to publicly acknowledge our winner.<br>
												We'll be announcing the winner on 
												<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MtPilchuckPTA" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>
												at the start of the sale, so be sure to stop by and congratulation the talented winner!</a>
