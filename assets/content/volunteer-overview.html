Did you know that you do not need to be a PTA member to be a volunteer? If you'd like to be
notified about volunteer opportunities, please <a
    href="mailto:mt.pilchuckpta@gmail.com">send us your email</a>

<b>Joining this list doesn't commit you to anything</b>, you'll just get periodic emails
letting you know what the PTA is up to and where we are in need of volunteers.<br>

<!-- All volunteers need to go through the LSSD background check process prior to volunteering at school or with kids.
Download the application <a href="https://www.lkstevens.wednet.edu/cms/lib/WA01001468/Centricity/Domain/985/Volunteer%20Application%20Form_fillable.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> 
or pick one up from the school office.  (Note that volunteering with PTA requires this application only if working with students or at school.)
