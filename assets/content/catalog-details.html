									<tr>
										<td><b>How does it work?</b></td>

											toward prize eligibility,
											and profits from the sale come to Mt Pilchuck PTA.

									<tr>
										<td><b>What if I don't want to sell stuff to my friends and family?</b></td>
										<td>First of all, please know that we do not expect every family to participate
											in every fundraiser.
											We try to have a variety of ways to participate in raising funds for the
											school.
											If this one's not for you, we understand! Please feel entirely free to opt
											out completely!

									<tr>
										<td><b>I would still like to support PTA. Can't I do that without selling
												stuff?</b></td>
										<td>Yes!
											From your student's online store, choose the $20 cash donation item.
											Sales of this item are 100% profit, meaning that every penny you donate goes
											directly to fund programs that benefit Mt Pilchuck.

										<td><b>How will people get their orders?</b></td>
										<td>Because of the social distancing measures in place due to Covid-19, this
											year's fundraiser will consist
											entirely of orders shipped directly to the purchaser. Shipping costs will be
											paid by the purchaser and can be
											calculated prior to purchase from the shopping cart.

									<tr>
										<td><b>How will my student get their prizes?</b></td>
										<td>Prizes will be shipped directly to your student.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><b>Why do a fundraiser when school is not physically in session?</b></td>
										<td>PTA is still supporting Mt Pilchuck! We may not be able to hold family
											events,
											but we can help with other kids of extras like paying for access to virtual
											fundraisers,
											buying art or science supplies to send home with students, and supporting
											teachers
											in their distance and/or hybrid teaching model.<br><br>
											Every year, PTA also makes purchases that benefit the school for the long
											term --
											items like science kits, a sound system, playground equipment, and water
											bottle fillers --
											and we are looking forward to when students will be physically together
											again.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><b>Why do a fundraiser when so many people are hurting financially?</b></td>
										<td>We thought long and hard about that. We are anticipating lower than usual
											income from this fundraiser.
											But we do still have expenses, and since fundraising is optional, we decided
											to go ahead and give people the opportunity.<br><br>
											Because we know many of our families are hurting, this year we are also
											donating a percentage of the proceeds of this sale
											to <a href="https://www.hungryheartsfoundation.com/" target="_blank">The
												Hungry Hearts Foundation</a> a Lake Stevens non-profit that provides
											take-home meals for
											students facing food insecurity due to financial need.<br><br>
											In addition, for every thousand items sold, 100 meals will be donated to
											<a href="https://www.northwestharvest.org/" target="_blank">Northwest
												Harvest</a> in Mt Pilchuck's name.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td><b>I have another question or problem about the fundraiser. Who can I
												ask?</b></td>
										<td>Your best bet is to direct your questions to Northwest Fundraising directly.
											You can call them at <b>800-779-1706</b> or
											by email at <a
												href="mailto: customer.service@nwfundraising.com">customer.service@nwfundraising.com</a>.<br><br>
