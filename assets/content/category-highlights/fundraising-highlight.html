Our annual expenses run between $20,000 and $30,000.<br>
<br>
Roughly 95% of those funds go directly to fund art, science, drama, music, STP, and all
manner of other fun at Mt Pilchuck.
<br><br>
In order to continue our current level of support for Mt Pilchuck, we do a variety of
fundraisers throughout the year.
